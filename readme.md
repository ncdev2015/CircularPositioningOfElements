# Solar System in Godot

This example uses 2D position node and animate it addng movement with GDScript and Physics formula:

This is useful to learn rotation and angular (algebra) concepts.

First sample:

![Solar System](https://github.com/ncdev2015/CircularPositioningOfElements/blob/master/assets/example_1.png)

By pressing SPACE key adds a new planet to scene and this start with spining.

Second sample (planets with movement)

![Solar System](https://github.com/ncdev2015/CircularPositioningOfElements/blob/master/assets/updated.png)

Considerations:
- By pressing the SPACE key it adds a new planet
- The center of each planet is the Sun
- Modify angular velocities to increase o decrease spin velocity
